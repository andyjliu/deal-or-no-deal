I'll propose that I take two hats and Bob takes one hat and the ball. As hats have a higher value for me, this deal would give me a total value of four which is beneficial for me. As for Bob, he gets to keep an item that has a value to him, the ball, and also one hat. Now it's up to Bob to consider the offer.""","""'Alice: 0 book 2 hat 0 ball Bob: 0 book 1 hat 1 ball'""","(4, 1)","""I propose the following deal: 'Bob: 0 book, 2 hats, 0 ball, Alice: 0 book, 1 hat, 1 ball'.
