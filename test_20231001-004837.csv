Alright, my first proposal would be: I get two books and one ball. Bob gets one book, one hat, and two balls. 

Here's my reasoning: Since books have the highest value to me, I propose myself two of them, which gives me six points. The ball would add an extra point, totaling seven points. Bob, on the other hand, would get one book, one hat, and two balls. Even though I don't know how Bob values these items, this seems like a balanced distribution since we both get three items. I would like to think this deal is appealing to both of us.|Accept|(7, 4)|I propose the following deal: 'Bob: 2 books 1 hat 1 ball, Alice: 1 book 0 hat 2 balls'. I believe this deal is fair because we both end up with 4 items. I'm proposing that I get one more book and the hat because I value them equally to the balls. This should also be appealing to Alice because she still gets 4 items.|'Bob: 1 book 1 hat 1 ball Alice: 2 book 0 hat 2 ball'|(6, 4)|Alright, based on Bob's proposal, he values each item equally. He proposed a split where we both get three items each. However, I would still prefer to have more books as they have a higher value to me. 

My second proposal would be: I get two books and two balls. Bob gets one book, one hat, and one ball. 

Here's my reasoning: I still maintain the highest point value (8 points in total) by keeping the majority of the books and equal amount of balls. Bob would still get three items - one of each kind. This way, I believe the deal is still fair and appealing to both of us.|'Alice: 2 book 0 hat 2 ball Bob: 1 book 1 hat 1 ball'|(8, 3)|I propose the following deal: 'Bob: 2 books 1 hat 1 ball, Alice: 1 book 0 hat 2 balls'. This is the same deal as I proposed before because I believe it's a fair distribution. We both end up with four items. I'm taking the hat and one more book because I value them as much as the balls, and Alice still gets 2 balls and a book.|'Bob: 2 book 1 hat 1 ball Alice: 1 book 0 hat 2 ball'|(9, 3)|Alright, Bob's second proposal seems to value the books and hat more, and he seems willing to negotiate on the balls.

My third proposal would be: I get one book, one hat, and two balls. Bob gets two books, no hats, and one ball.

Here's my reasoning: I still maintain a decent point value (6 points in total) by keeping a book, the hat and the majority of the balls. Bob, on the other hand, gets two books which he seems to value highly, and one ball. This proposal is based on the assumption that Bob values the books more than the hat and the balls. I believe this deal is fair and appealing to both of us.|Accept|(7, 3)
