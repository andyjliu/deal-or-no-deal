This way, we both get a share of the items.""","Accept","(7, 7)","""As Alice, I maintain my previous proposal: 'Alice: 3 books 0 hat 0 balls, Bob: 0 book 1 hat 3 balls.' This is my final offer and it is appealing to me because it allows me to take all the books, which I value the most. If Bob values the hat and the balls, which he seems to, this deal should also be appealing to him.""","Accept","(9, 7)","""Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I would like to suggest a different distribution that takes into account my preferences as well. My proposal is: 'Bob: 2 books, 1 hat, 1 ball. Alice: 1 book, 0 hats, 2 balls'.

This deal is appealing to me because I value the books highly, and I would get two out of three. I also get a hat and a ball. For Alice, this deal could be appealing as she still gets a book and more balls than in her original proposal. This way, we both have a share of the items we value.""","Accept","(7, 7)"
