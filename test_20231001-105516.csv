This way, I am getting a value of 5 (2 for the book and 3 for the hat) and Bob is getting 5 items. Even though I don't know how he values each item, this seems fair as we are both getting the same quantity of items. Plus, I have no value for the balls, so I am okay with Bob having all of them.""","""'Alice: 1 book 1 hat 0 ball Bob: 0 book 2 hat 3 ball'""","(5, 15)","""I propose the following deal: 'Bob: 0 book, 3 hats, 2 balls; Alice: 1 book, 0 hats, 1 ball.' This proposed split gives me, Bob, all the items that have value to me, and leaves Alice with a book that has no value to me and one ball. I assume Alice values the book more than I do, since it has a value of zero to me, and she still gets to keep a ball.""","Accept","(8, 3)"
