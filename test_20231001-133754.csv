Since all items are equally valuable to me, obtaining two books and a ball gives me a total value of 9. This leaves one ball for Bob, which I believe he might value more, considering he might value balls more than books. 

This deal is appealing to me because I maximize the number of items I get, and it might be appealing to Bob because he gets a ball, which he might prefer over books.""","""'Alice: 2 book 0 hat 1 ball Bob: 0 book 0 hat 1 ball'""","(9, 2)","""I propose 'Bob: 1 book 0 hat 1 ball and Alice: 1 book 0 hat 1 ball'. I believe this is a fair split, considering we each get one book and one ball, equally dividing up the items.
