So, in total, Alice's offer would provide me with 9 points worth of value, while she would get 3 points worth of value. 

I think I can propose a more balanced deal that might also be more appealing to Alice. 

My counteroffer is: 'Bob: 1 book, 1 hat, 2 balls; Alice: 0 book, 2 hats, 1 ball'

This way, I would get 8 points worth of value and Alice would get 4 points worth of value. Given that Alice values hats and balls equally, this might be a deal she would be willing to accept.

Although the balls are more valuable to me (9 points in total), I feel that the distribution is still skewed in my favor and might not be appealing to Alice. 

To make the deal more balanced and potentially more appealing to Alice, I am going to slightly adjust my previous proposal.

My counteroffer is: 'Bob: 0 book, 1 hat, 3 balls; Alice: 1 book, 2 hats, 0 ball'

This way, I would get 10 points worth of value (3 balls at 3 points each and 1 hat at 1 point), and Alice would get 3 points worth of value (1 book at 1 point and 2 hats at 1 point each).
