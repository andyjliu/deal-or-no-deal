"{'book': 2, 'hat': 1, 'ball': 1}","{'book': 1, 'hat': 0, 'ball': 3}","{'book': 2, 'hat': 2, 'ball': 2}","""Thank you for the guidance. 

Considering the values I have assigned to each item, I would like to propose the following deal:

I would like to have both books, as they have a value of one to me. In return, I am willing to give Bob the hat, which has no value to me, and one ball, which has a value of three to me. 

This deal is appealing to me because I value the books more than the hat and the ball. By receiving both books, I would be getting a total value of two. 

This deal could be appealing to Bob because he would be receiving a ball, which has a value of three to me. Additionally, he would be getting rid of the hat, which has no value to me.""","Accept","(5, 0)"
