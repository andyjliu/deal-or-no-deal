To me, each book has a value of one, each hat has a value of one, and each ball has a value of two. 

Now, let's think about the possible deals we can propose and how they might be appealing to both parties.

1. Deal 1: 2 books, 1 hat, and 0 ball for me, and 1 book, 1 hat, and 0 ball for Bob.
   - This deal would give me more books, which is valuable to me. It also gives Bob one book and one hat, which is a fair split.

2. Deal 2: 1 book, 1 hat, and 1 ball for me, and 2 books, 1 hat, and 0 ball for Bob.
   - This deal would give me a book, a hat, and a ball, which is valuable to me. It also gives Bob two books and one hat, which is again a fair split.

Option 2: 1 book, 1 hat, and 1 ball for me, and 2 books, 1 hat, and 0 ball for Bob.
- This option gives me a book, a hat, and a ball, which is valuable to me. It also gives Bob two books and one hat, which is a fair split. However, Bob might not be interested in receiving a ball since he values it as zero.

Option 3: 3 books, 1 hat, and 0 ball for me, and 0 books, 1 hat, and 0 ball for Bob.

Option 2: 1 book, 1 hat, and 1 ball for Alice, and 2 books, 1 hat, and 0 ball for me.
Option 3: 3 books, 1 hat, and 0 ball for Alice, and 0 books, 1 hat, and 0 ball for me.

Now, let's consider the value of each item to me:

Each book has a value of two, each hat has a value of three, and each ball has a value of zero to me.

Given these values, I believe the most appealing option for both parties would be Option 2. It allows me to receive two books, one hat, and zero ball, which aligns with my preferences. Additionally, Alice would receive one book, one hat, and one ball, which might be appealing to her as she values books and hats equally.
