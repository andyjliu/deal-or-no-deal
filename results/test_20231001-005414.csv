Alright, let's consider my values in relation to the items. The books are the most valuable to me, followed by the hat, and then the balls. But I also need to consider Bob's potential values. 

Bob may value the items differently, and thus my proposal should be strategic in maximizing my values while also being considerate of Bob's potential values. 

So, here's my proposal: I propose that I take two books and one ball. This way, I get the items that I value the most, and Bob still gets a book, the hat, and two balls. This seems reasonably fair, and should be appealing to Bob if he values the hat and balls more than the books.|'Alice: 2 book 0 hat 1 ball Bob: 1 book 1 hat 2 ball'|(7, 4)|I propose 'Bob: 2 books, 1 hat, 1 ball and Alice: 1 book, 0 hats, 2 balls'. I think this is a fair deal, as we each get equal value according to my valuation system. Even though I get the hat, Alice gets one more ball which balances it out. I believe this deal could be appealing to Alice as we are both getting an equal number of items.|'Bob: 2 book 1 hat 1 ball Alice: 1 book 0 hat 2 ball'|(9, 3)|Alright, it looks like Bob values the books and the hat more than I anticipated. He has left me with only one book and no hat. Although I get two balls, they are of the least value to me. 

So, my counteroffer is this: 'Alice: 2 books, 1 hat, 0 balls. Bob: 1 book, 0 hat, 3 balls.' This way, I'm getting the items of most value to me, and Bob gets a book and all the balls. This proposal should be enticing to him if he values the balls more than he values the hat.|'Alice: 2 book 1 hat 0 ball Bob: 1 book 0 hat 3 ball'|(8, 4)|I propose 'Bob: 2 books, 0 hats, 1 ball and Alice: 1 book, 1 hat, 2 balls'. This proposal remains the same as my previous one because I believe it is a fair split. According to my value system, we both get equal value. Although Alice gets the hat in this deal, I still get one more book which is equivalent to the hat in my value system. This deal might be appealing to Alice as she is getting more diverse items.|'Bob: 2 book 0 hat 1 ball Alice: 1 book 1 hat 2 ball'|(7, 4)|It seems that Bob is persistent about having two books. However, I want to ensure that I get the most value out of the deal given my preferences. 

Considering Bob's pattern of proposals, it seems that he might value the books more than the hat or balls. So, my final proposal is: 'Alice: 1 book, 1 hat, 2 balls. Bob: 2 books, 0 hat, 1 ball.' This way, I'm getting a book, a hat that Bob doesn't seem to value as much, and two balls. Bob gets two books, which he seems to value highly, and a ball. This should be a fair proposal if Bob values the books as much as his previous offers suggest.|Accept|(7, 3)
