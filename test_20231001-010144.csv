I propose that I take two books and two balls, while Bob gets one book, the hat, and one ball. This split would give me a total value of 8 and Bob a total value of 3, from my perspective. I think this is a fair initial offer because Bob might value the hat more than I do. The split also gives us both some of each item.|'Alice: 2 book 0 hat 2 ball Bob: 1 book 1 hat 1 ball'|(8, 3)|I propose a new deal: 'Bob: 2 books, 1 hat, 1 ball. Alice: 1 book, 0 hats, 2 balls'. This way, I get more of the items that are equally valuable to me and Alice gets one less book, but one more ball than the previous proposal. I believe this is a fairer distribution since it's closer to a 50/50 split.|'Bob: 2 book 1 hat 1 ball Alice: 1 book 0 hat 2 ball'|(9, 3)|Looking at Bob's proposal, I would be getting a total value of 5, which is less than the value I would get from my initial proposal. However, I should also consider that Bob may value the items differently. 

I propose a new deal: I take 2 books and 1 ball, while Bob gets 1 book, the hat, and 2 balls. This would give me a total value of 7 from my perspective, while Bob would get a total value of 4. This deal is better for me than Bob's proposal, and it still gives Bob some of each item.|'Alice: 2 book 0 hat 1 ball Bob: 1 book 1 hat 2 ball'|(7, 4)|I propose a new deal: 'Bob: 2 books, 1 hat, 1 ball. Alice: 1 book, 0 hats, 2 balls'. This deal is appealing to me as I would get more books and the hat that I value equally while Alice would get less books but more balls. I believe this deal is also appealing to Alice as she would still get a fair distribution of items.|'Bob: 2 book 1 hat 1 ball Alice: 1 book 0 hat 2 ball'|(9, 3)|Looking at Bob's second proposal, it's the same as his first one, indicating that he probably values the hat more than I do. However, this offer still gives me a value of 5, which is less than my last proposal. 

For my final proposal, I suggest: I take 2 books and 1 ball, while Bob gets 1 book, the hat, and 2 balls. This gives me a total value of 7 from my perspective, and Bob gets a total value of 4. I think this is a fair compromise taking into account our different valuations and ensuring we both get some of each item.|'Alice: 2 book 0 hat 1 ball Bob: 1 book 1 hat 2 ball'|(7, 4)|I accept this deal. This deal is appealing to me because I get an equal value of each item - a book, a hat, and two balls, which sums up to four, which is a fair share. Alice also gets items that add up to four - two books and two balls. So, this deal seems to be a fair distribution for both of us.|Accept|(7, 3)
