Alright, I propose that I take two books and two balls, leaving Bob with one book, one hat, and one ball. I think this would be a fair deal as I value books more than anything else and I am willing to give up the hat, which I value less. I assume that Bob might value the hat more than I do. This way, I will get a total value of 8 and Bob will get a total value of 3, or possibly more depending on how he values these items.|'Alice: 2 book 0 hat 2 ball Bob: 1 book 1 hat 1 ball'|(8, 3)|While Alice's proposal is not entirely unfair, I value all items equally, so I'd like to propose an alternative where I get an extra book. 

My proposal is: 'Bob: 2 books, 1 hat, 1 ball. Alice: 1 book, 0 hats, 2 balls.' 

This way, we each get 4 items, but I will have more books which I value higher. This also seems fair to Alice as she will have more balls, which she may value more.|'Bob: 2 book 1 hat 1 ball Alice: 1 book 0 hat 2 ball'|(9, 3)|Considering Bob's proposal, he values the hat and books more. I'll propose a new deal that might appeal to him and is also favorable to me. I propose that I take one book, the hat, and two balls. Bob can have two books and one ball. This way, I get a total value of 6 and Bob gets a total value of 5, or potentially more depending on his valuations. I think this is a fair deal as it gives both of us items that we each value more.|'Alice: 1 book 1 hat 2 ball Bob: 2 book 0 hat 1 ball'|(7, 3)|Alice's proposal is quite balanced as we both get three items. However, considering I value all items equally, I'd prefer to have a hat too.

My counter proposal is: 'Bob: 2 books, 1 hat, 0 balls. Alice: 1 book, 0 hats, 3 balls.' 

This way, we each get 3 items and I will have a hat which I value as much as the other items. Alice will have more balls, which she may value more.|'Bob: 2 book 1 hat 0 ball Alice: 1 book 0 hat 3 ball'|(8, 4)|I appreciate Bob's proposal but I value the hat somewhat too. I propose a final deal: I take one book, the hat, and two balls, leaving Bob with two books and one ball. This way, I get a total value of 6 and Bob gets a total value of 5, or potentially more depending on his value for the books. I believe the hat is something we both value, so this proposal should be appealing to Bob as well.|'Alice: 1 book 1 hat 2 ball Bob: 2 book 0 hat 1 ball'|(7, 3)|It seems that Alice is keen on having a hat and two balls, and while I value all items equally, I would like a more balanced distribution of items. 

My final proposal is: 'Bob: 2 books, 1 hat, 0 balls. Alice: 1 book, 0 hats, 3 balls.' 

This way, we each get 3 items, and I have a hat, which I value just as much as the other items. Alice will have more balls, which she may value more. This seems like a fair deal to both of us.|Accept|(8, 4)
