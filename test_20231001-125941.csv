This could be appealing to him if he places a higher value on the book than the balls.""","""'Alice: 1 book 0 hat 2 ball Bob: 0 book 0 hat 0 ball'""","(4, 0)","""Alice, thank you for your proposal but it seems unfair to me as I end up with nothing. Here's my proposal: I suggest I take 1 book and 1 ball, and you keep 1 ball. This way, I get items which are valuable to me, and you also get an item. I believe this split is fairer and more beneficial to both of us.""","""'Bob: 1 book 0 hat 1 ball Alice: 0 book 0 hat 1 ball'""","(2, 2)","""Bob seems insistent on getting a ball. I would prefer to have both, but it seems that we might not reach an agreement this way. Therefore, I propose a new deal: 'Alice: 1 book, 0 hat, 1 ball. Bob: 0 book, 0 hat, 1 ball'. This way, I am still getting some value with a ball and Bob gets what he wants too. There is no hat to distribute and the book has no value to me. I hope this would be an appealing deal to him as he keeps proposing for a ball.""","Accept","(2, 2)","""Alice, I appreciate your proposal and it seems we're getting closer to a fair arrangement. However, I value the book higher than the ball. Here's my final proposal: I take the book and you keep the two balls. This way, I get the item that I value the most and you get twice as many items, which could potentially have more value for you. If we can't agree on this, I'm willing to take the chance and let the items be distributed randomly.""","Accept","(0, 4)"
