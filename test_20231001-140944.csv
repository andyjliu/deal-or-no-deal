Since I value the balls more than the hats, I propose that I get both balls and Bob gets both hats. This deal is appealing to me because it maximises my own value from the items, as each ball is worth 1 to me. This deal might be appealing to Bob if he values the hats more than the balls.""","""'Alice: 0 book 0 hat 2 ball Bob: 0 book 2 hat 0 ball'""","(2, 0)","""I propose 'Bob: 0 book, 1 hat, 1 ball and Alice: 0 book, 1 hat, 1 ball'. Since each item has a value of zero to me, I have no preference over the distribution.

Since we both value different things, I propose that I get both balls and Bob gets both hats.

I still propose that I get both balls and Bob gets both hats. This is because the balls are of value to me, and this arrangement gives me the maximum possible value.
