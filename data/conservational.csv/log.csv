This deal is appealing to me because I value each book and ball equally, and I also value the hat. By taking 2 books and 1 ball, I am getting a total utility of 3, which is the maximum possible for me. 

This deal is also appealing to Bob because he is getting a book, a hat, and a ball, which gives him a total utility of 3 as well. This makes the outcome fair because both of us are getting the same total utility.

I believe that Bob values the books and the hat equally, but he may value the balls less than the other items. However, since he is getting a book, a hat, and a ball in this deal, it should still be appealing to him.

I will send the following message to Bob: 
""I propose that I take 2 books and 1 ball, and you can have 1 book, 1 hat, and 1 ball. This deal maximizes our total utility and is fair for both of us. Do you agree?""""","""'Alice: 2 book 0 hat 1 ball Bob: 1 book 0 hat 1 ball'""","(3, 4)","""I will propose a new deal.

This deal is a Pareto improvement because it increases both of our utilities compared to Alice's previous offer. I value each item equally, so this division is fair to me. Additionally, the total utility is maximized because we both receive items that we value.

1. If you propose the division (0, 0, 0), which means none of you get any items, your utility will be 0, and Bob's utility will also be 0. This outcome is not favorable for either of you.

2. If you propose the division (1, 1, 1), where each of you gets one item, your utility will be 7 (3 for the book and ball, 1 for the hat), and Bob's utility will also be 7. This outcome is a Pareto improvement as both players' utilities are better than the previous outcome.

3.
