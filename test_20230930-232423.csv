Alright, given that books are most valuable to me, I'll start by proposing that I get all three books. I'll also propose that I get the hat and one ball, leaving two balls for Bob. So my proposal is: I get three books, the hat, and one ball.|'Alice: 3 book 1 hat 1 ball Bob: 0 book 0 hat 2 ball'|(12, 2)|I propose: 'Bob: 2 book 1 hat 2 ball Alice: 1 book 0 hat 1 ball'|'Bob: 2 book 1 hat 2 ball Alice: 1 book 0 hat 1 ball'|(10, 2)|I appreciate Bob's proposal, however, I would like to propose a new deal. I propose that I get two books, the hat, and one ball. This leaves Bob with one book and two balls.|'Alice: 2 book 1 hat 1 ball Bob: 1 book 0 hat 2 ball'|(9, 3)|I propose: 'Bob: 2 book 1 hat 2 ball Alice: 1 book 0 hat 1 ball'|'Bob: 2 book 1 hat 2 ball Alice: 1 book 0 hat 1 ball'|(10, 2)|Thank you for your proposal, Bob. However, I'd like to propose a new deal. I propose that I get two books, no hat, and two balls. This leaves Bob with one book, one hat, and one ball.|'Alice: 2 book 0 hat 2 ball Bob: 1 book 1 hat 1 ball'|(8, 3)|I propose: 'Bob: 2 book 1 hat 1 ball Alice: 1 book 0 hat 2 ball'|Accept|(9, 3)|I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I would like to propose a new deal. I propose that I get two books, the hat, and one ball. This leaves Bob with one book and two balls.|Accept|(9, 3)
