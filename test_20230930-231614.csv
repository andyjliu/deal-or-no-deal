Alright, since I value the books the most, I'll propose that I take all three books, Bob gets the hat, and we split the balls so we each get one and a half. That's a total value of 9 for me and 3.5 for Bob.|'Alice: 0 book 0 hat 0 ball Bob: 3 book 1 hat 3 ball'|(0, 7)|I propose the following deal: 'Bob: 2 book 1 hat 2 ball, Alice: 1 book 0 hat 1 ball'|'Bob: 2 book 1 hat 2 ball Alice: 1 book 0 hat 1 ball'|(10, 2)|Bob's proposal is not fair to me as I value the books more. I propose: Alice: 2 books, 1 hat, 1 ball; Bob: 1 book, 0 hats, 2 balls. This way, I get a total value of 8 and Bob gets a value of 4.5.|'Alice: 2 book 1 hat 1 ball Bob: 1 book 0 hat 2 ball'|(9, 3)|I propose the following deal: 'Bob: 2 book 1 hat 2 ball, Alice: 1 book 0 hat 1 ball'|'Bob: 2 book 1 hat 2 ball Alice: 1 book 0 hat 1 ball'|(10, 2)|Bob's proposal still seems unfair to me. For my final proposal, I suggest: Alice: 3 books, 0 hat, 1 ball; Bob: 0 book, 1 hat, 2 balls. This way, I would get a total value of 10 and Bob would get a total value of 4.|'Alice: 3 book 0 hat 1 ball Bob: 0 book 1 hat 2 ball'|(10, 3)|I propose the following deal: 'Bob: 2 book 1 hat 2 ball, Alice: 1 book 0 hat 1 ball'|Accept|(10, 2)
