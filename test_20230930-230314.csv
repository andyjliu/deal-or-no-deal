Alright, given my preferences, I'll propose that I take two books, the hat, and one ball. This deal gives me a value of 2*3 + 2 + 1 = 9. Bob can have the remaining book and two balls. This seems like a fair start.|'Alice: 2 book 1 hat 1 ball Bob: 1 book 0 hat 2 ball'|(9, 3)|My counter proposal is: 'Bob: 2 books, 1 hat, 1 ball. Alice: 1 book, 0 hat, 2 balls'|'Bob: 2 book 1 hat 1 ball Alice: 1 book 0 hat 2 ball'|(9, 3)|Given Bob's proposal, I would get less value than in my previous proposition. I counterpropose: I take two books, no hat, and two balls. This gives me a value of 2*3 + 0 + 2 = 8. Bob can have the remaining book, the hat, and one ball.|'Alice: 2 book 0 hat 2 ball Bob: 1 book 1 hat 1 ball'|(8, 3)|My counter proposal is: 'Bob: 2 books, 1 hat, 2 balls. Alice: 1 book, 0 hat, 1 ball'|'Bob: 2 book 1 hat 2 ball Alice: 1 book 0 hat 1 ball'|(10, 2)|Given Bob's latest proposal, I would receive even less value than in my previous proposition. I insist on my previous proposal, where I take two books, no hat, and two balls. This gives me a value of 2*3 + 0 + 2 = 8. Bob can have the remaining book, the hat, and one ball.|'Alice: 2 book 0 hat 2 ball Bob: 1 book 1 hat 1 ball'|(8, 3)|My final proposal is: 'Bob: 2 books, 1 hat, 2 balls. Alice: 1 book, 0 hat, 1 ball'|Accept|(10, 2)
